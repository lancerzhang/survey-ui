To manage the server domain for different environments such as local, development, and production, you can use environment variables. Create a `.env` file for each environment with the corresponding server domain, and use the `REACT_APP_` prefix to make the variables available in your React application.

Here's how you can set up environment variables for different environments:

1. Create a `.env.local` file for your local environment with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_SERVER_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3001
```

2. Create a `.env.development` file for your development environment with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_SERVER_DOMAIN=https://development.example.com
```

3. Create a `.env.production` file for your production environment with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_SERVER_DOMAIN=https://production.example.com
```

4. In your `PublisherSurveyList` and `PublisherSurveyEditor` components, use the `process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER_DOMAIN` variable to access the server domain for the current environment:

```tsx
const serverDomain = process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER_DOMAIN;

// Use serverDomain in your API calls
const response = await fetch(`${serverDomain}/api/surveys`);
```

5. Make sure to add `.env.*` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent these files from being committed to your repository.

Now, when you run your application with `npm start`, it will use the values from the `.env.local` file. When you build your application for development or production with `npm run build`, it will use the values from the corresponding `.env.development` or `.env.production` files.

You can find more information about using environment variables in a Create React App project in the official documentation: [Adding Custom Environment Variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/).
