You are correct that the `:id` in the path is the survey ID. If you want to use the same `PublisherSurveyEditor` component for both editing existing surveys and creating new ones, you can pass a special value for the `id` parameter to indicate that a new survey is being created.

A common approach is to pass the value `new` for the `id` parameter when creating a new survey. This way, you can differentiate between creating a new survey and editing an existing one based on the value of `id`.

In your `LayoutWrapper.tsx`, change the route for creating a new survey like this:

```tsx
<Menu.Item key="2" onClick={() => handleClick('/publisher/survey-editor/new')}>
  Create Survey
</Menu.Item>
```

Then, in your `PublisherSurveyEditor` component, you can check the value of `id` to determine if you should load an existing survey or create a new one. You can access the `id` using the `useParams` hook from the `react-router-dom` package:

```tsx
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

const PublisherSurveyEditor: React.FC = () => {
  const { id } = useParams<{ id: string }>();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (id === 'new') {
      // Initialize a new survey
    } else {
      // Load the survey with the given ID
    }
  }, [id]);

  // Rest of the component
};
```

In this example, the `useEffect` hook checks the value of `id`. If it's equal to `'new'`, it initializes a new survey. Otherwise, it loads the survey with the given ID.
