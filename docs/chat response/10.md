To navigate to the `PublisherSurveyEditor` page with the survey ID when a survey item is clicked, you'll need to update the `PublisherSurveyList` component to include the `history` object from React Router. You can use the `useHistory` hook from `react-router-dom` to access the history object.

Step 1: Import useHistory

In the `src/pages/PublisherSurveyList.tsx` file, import the `useHistory` hook:

```tsx
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
```

Step 2: Update the PublisherSurveyList component

Modify the `PublisherSurveyList` component to include the `useHistory` hook and handle the survey item click:

```tsx
const PublisherSurveyList: React.FC = () => {
  // ... (previous code)

  const history = useHistory();

  const handleItemClick = (surveyId: number) => {
    history.push(`/publisher/survey-editor/${surveyId}`);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... (previous code) */}
      <List
        itemLayout="vertical"
        dataSource={surveys}
        renderItem={(survey: any) => (
          <List.Item
            key={survey.id}
            onClick={() => handleItemClick(survey.id)}
            extra={
              <div>
                <Avatar icon={<UserOutlined />} />
                {survey.user.username}
              </div>
            }
          >
            <List.Item.Meta
              title={survey.title}
              description={survey.description}
            />
          </List.Item>
        )}
      />
      {/* ... (previous code) */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this updated `PublisherSurveyList` component, the `handleItemClick` function is added to handle clicks on survey items. This function navigates to the `PublisherSurveyEditor` page with the corresponding survey ID. The `onClick` event listener is added to the `List.Item` component to trigger the `handleItemClick` function when a survey item is clicked.

Now, when you click on a survey item, it will navigate to the `PublisherSurveyEditor` page along with the survey ID in the URL. Make sure the `PublisherSurveyEditor` component is properly set up to handle the survey ID passed via the URL.
