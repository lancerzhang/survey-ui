To fetch the list of surveys and render them on the screen, you'll need to make an HTTP request to the API and then update the state of the component with the response data. You can use the `fetch()` function to make the HTTP request and the `useState()` and `useEffect()` hooks to manage the component's state and side effects.

Step 1: Update the PublisherSurveyList component

Modify the `src/pages/PublisherSurveyList.tsx` file to fetch the list of surveys and render them on the screen:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Card, Row, Col } from 'antd';

const PublisherSurveyList: React.FC = () => {
  const [surveys, setSurveys] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchSurveys = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://your-api-url-here.com/surveys');
      const data = await response.json();
      setSurveys(data);
    };

    fetchSurveys();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Surveys</h1>
      <Row gutter={[16, 16]}>
        {surveys.map((survey: any) => (
          <Col key={survey.id} xs={24} sm={12} md={8} lg={6}>
            <Card title={survey.title} bordered={false}>
              <p>{survey.description}</p>
              <p>Created by: {survey.user.username}</p>
            </Card>
          </Col>
        ))}
      </Row>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PublisherSurveyList;
```

Replace `'https://your-api-url-here.com/surveys'` with the actual API URL you're using to fetch the surveys.

This updated `PublisherSurveyList` component fetches the list of surveys from the API and renders them as cards in a responsive grid layout. Each card displays the survey title, description, and the creator's username. The `useState()` hook manages the `surveys` state, and the `useEffect()` hook handles fetching the data when the component mounts.

Don't forget to handle errors and edge cases, such as an empty list of surveys or errors when fetching data from the API.
